            <h5>Repo The Genetic Opera</h5>
            <p>This movie is a project has nurtured from performing is small on time on stages to the big screen. It also gave Terrance a 
                look into how cutthroat the business can really be. While it didn't do so well during its initial release, it earned a cult 
                following in the following years.  The movie is about a girl, who believed to be sick, is kept locked up in her room by her 
                father. In a dangerous world where an overdue payment on a replacement organ can mean you'll be taken down and the organ reprocessed.
                She soon finds a way out and is lead around by the Graverobber who seems to be the only individual who hasn't tried to lie to her.  
                The movie goes on to show how she learns the truth about her illness, her dead mother, and her seemingly innocent father. This movie 
                is truly a fan favorite but do some creative differences, Terrance had decided to step away from the big corporations and work a bit 
                more independently</p>

            <h5>The Devil's Carnival</h5>
            <p>The Devil's Carnival, released in 2012, is a musical horror film. A strange concept at first but it works. The main characters in the film actually 
                represent one of three of Aesop's Fable. This first movie shows more of the Carnival or Hell. It shows Lucifer giving "lessons" to the poor souls 
                who find themselves there in an opportunity for them to learn what got them there. We are shown Lucifer as a Ring Leader and God as a perfectionist 
                doll maker.  
                <img src="http://morbidlybeautiful.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/devilscarnival.jpg" style width="100%">
            The 2nd movie, we see more of Heaven and learn more about some characters history. By the end, we are left wondering if the good guys are really the 
                good guys. That peaking behind the curtain in what you think is a wonderful place can leave you banished and broken. Terrance and his partners 
                were no longer relying on big-name corporations to help promote the film. So they took it upon themselves to travel to theaters all over the 
                country, getting the news out there. Even fans joined in and spend word of the new projects quickly.

            <h5>American Murder Song</h5>
            <p>American Murder Song is like a traveling carnival but with music. Terrance and a handful of his buddies packed into a tiny 
                van and traveled around the country performing shows. Its a project funded and promoted solely by them and their fans. It 
                has been done in two parts so far.
                The first being The Year without a summer or 1816. It was based on, as the name says, 
                the year 1816 which was one of the longest winters to date. They wrote and performed songs centered on the lives of individuals
                who committed murder or of violent murders. One such individual is Lavinia Fisher who is actually rumored to be the first female 
                serial killer. <br>

                The 2nd part was The Donner Party Tour which focused on the Donner family and companions as they made the dangerous trek West. 
                They were a cannibalistic family.  </p>

            <h5>Anti-Recital</h5>
            <p>Terrance's latest project is an Anti-Recital which is a more intimate show with only Terrance, his singing partner Saar, a piano,
               some couches and only 30 guests. It is a night where he promises to sing a variety of songs from across all his projects and 
               answer any question presented to them.

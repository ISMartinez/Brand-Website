       <div class="about"> 
        <p>	Terrance Zdunich is an artist, singer, writer, actor, composer, producer, illustrator, and storyboard artist.
            In his most recent musical project, he is working alongside Saar Hendelman on the Anti-Recital. A travelling show of musical intrigue. 
            Before the Anti-Recital, he started out as storyboard artist in animation moving on to a freelance artist after feeling frustrated creatively. 
            After teaching drawing and painting he moved on to attending acting classes in South Coast Repertory Theatre. There he met Darren Smith. While 
            performing 10-minute operas together, they decided to turn The Necro-merchant's Debt, into a full length piece, due to the positive response 
            it had received. As time went on, they found their director Darren Lynn Bousman to create Repo The Genetic Opera. Repo was released on the big 
            screen in 2008, almost 6 years after the idea was pitched and presented on a theatrical stage. While it did not have a successful release in 
            theaters, it soon became a cult classic. 
            After releasing the movie, Terrance began a more artist project. He began working on his comic book, The Molting which was released independently. 
            He had written the story arc completely before anything was drawn.
